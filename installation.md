To install:

1. Download files from github. Download zip. Unzip to any directory - desktop or documents will work.
2. Get a sump GUI. I use Logic Sniffer (ols.lxtreme.nl). Download the latest zip file and unzip to any directory. Requires Java JRE to be installed.
3. If using Logic Sniffer, copy the configuration files from logic_analyzer/logic_sniffer to ols-0.9.7.2/plugins

To run:

1. Load Teensy with the logic analyzer code and run (LED should be blinking every 2 seconds).
2. In ols-0.9.7.2 directory, run or click on run.bat.
3.
