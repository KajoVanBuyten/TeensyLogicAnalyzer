# TeensyLogicAnalyzer
Logic Analyzer for the Teensy development boards (pjrc.com/teensy)

### Beta Release 3.

It now compiles under Arduino 1.6.7, adds Teensy LC

This version supports Teensy 3.1/3.2 up to 2 MHz and Teensy LC up to 500 kHz. I don't have a Teensy 3.0 to test with, but it should also support it. If anyone can test it, let me know if it works.

See installation.md for setup.

For demonstration purposes, uncomment line 35 of the main file to see 25 kHz signals (varying duty cycles) on channels 4-7 (channels 4-5 on LC).

User Guide is coming soon.
